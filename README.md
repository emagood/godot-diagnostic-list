# Godot Diagnostic List

This editor plugin provides project-wide diagnostics for GDScript files.<br/>
It tracks every GDScript file in the project and gathers all errors and warnings in a global list.<br/>
Especially useful when working on large-scale changes, e.g. refactoring or porting a project from Godot 3.x to 4.x.

Compatible with Godot 4.2+.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin from this repository or from the [Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2482)
2. Copy the `addons/` directory to your project
3. Enable the plugin in the project settings
4. (Possibly) Restart Godot

## Usage

**NOTE**: It is not possible to run multiple Godot instances with this addon. See also [Known Issues](#known-issues).

The diagnostic panel appears in the bottom dock.

Double-clicking an entry opens the editor and jumps to the respective location in the script.

On the right side of the diagnostic panel are various controls:

- **Auto-Refresh**: Automatically refresh diagnostics when files have been modified. The plugin will only update diagnostics when the panel is visible.<br/>
  **NOTE:** In large projects, a diagnostic update can take up to several seconds. Hence, it might be desirable to deactivate this option in larger projects or keep the panel hidden until needed.
- **Refresh**: Manually trigger a refresh.
- **Group by file**: Change the sorting method to group diagnostics by their source file.
- **Diagnostic Filters**: Shows the amount of errors and warnings in the project.
  Toggling these buttons will show or hide those diagnostics from the list.


## Ignoring Directories

Directories with a `.gdignore` or `.diagnostic_ignore` file are ignored.
The latter is useful for ignoring certain directories without interfering with Godot behavior.

If the `debug/gdscript/warnings/exclude_addons` project setting is enabled, it will also ignore files in `addons/`.


# Known Issues

## Does not work correctly with multiple Godot instances

  This addon relies on the language server protocol to retrieve diagnostics from Godot.
  Godot starts a language server on the port defined in the editor settings under `network/language_server/remote_port`.
  If the port is already in use, e.g. by the LS of another Godot instance, Godot is unable to start a new LS.
  Hence, this plugin is unable to connect to the correct Godot instance and report correct diagnostics in such cases.
